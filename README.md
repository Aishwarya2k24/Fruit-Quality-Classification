This repository contains the code for training a deep learning model to classify the quality of fruits—specifically bananas, apples, and oranges—based on attributes like freshness and rottenness. The model used is VGG16, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, fine-tuned to perform fruit quality classification.



Key Features
Model Architecture: Based on VGG16, with custom modifications for fruit classification.


Training Data: Utilizes a dataset of fruit images labeled with freshness, rottenness, and calorie content.


Model Training: The model is trained to classify the fruit type and assess quality.


Loss and Accuracy Visualization: During training, graphs for loss and accuracy are generated to evaluate model performance.
